    title: "Blog 01 Introduction",
    text: "My name is Chris Farah, and I am a Junior here at UC studying computer science. I love software development and as such I am taking this class to learn about Digital Entrepreneurship and business models that digital businesses use to generate revenue and succeed online. I enjoy creating user-facing applications and the backends to support them. Seeing well-crafted applications with fantastic UX/UI (user experience and user interfaces) encourages me to design and develop my own applications. I have designed and created a few web applications such as this one and others featured on my page, and I am currently working on a functional website that users can purchase products and have them shipped to them. I am also working as a software engineer at Honeywell Intelligrated. I hope to learn about entrepreneurship and how to support an online business and learn from the wisdom of someone who has set out and started a business. This course contains lots of topics of interest for me such as emerging technologies that I hope will motivate me to innovate and create new software projects. In the future I would like to start my own business once an idea worthwhile comes my way and my hope is this class can prepare me enough that when the time comes, I am ready and capable of analyzing and starting my adventure. I am excited to start my journey into digital entrepreneurship with Professor Shewman and a great class and I hope that it will produce memories that will last a lifetime.",

    title: "Blog 02 If I had 1M to invest in goPro or 23 and me...",
    text: "If I had no choice but to invest 1 million dollars in either GoPro or 23 and me, I would most likely choose 23 and Me. Both 23 and Me and GoPro are companies which previously had giant shares in their respective markets. GoPro's propositional value is that they will provide you with equipment to record stunts and 23 and Me provides a service to get your DNA code and give you fun metrics associated with it. GoPro had a nice grip on the market in their prime with their brand being a staple of stunt recording equipment. I think GoPro does not have any value proposition that would guarantee its spot on the throne. 23 and Me, however, has had a recent scandal with its data being breached. With that being said, I would still invest there. I think that 23 and me have tons of data from its users that it can use to create new products and offer more to their value proposition. As of right now 23 and Me has lots of costs associated with their brand such as shipping the sample packages storing all the sample packages as well as testing the samples and uploading the data to the right spots online. For GoPro they have the cost of production, shipping to consumers, and web applications or mobile applications if they have them. I think 23 and Me have more room to pivot with their value proposition. With the DNA of hundreds of thousands of people they can work with other companies to create services geared toward that, for example they could work with medical professionals and create a new service that would scan your DNA for possible genetic mutations and with science constantly evolving They can sit until the right move presents itself.",

    title: "Blog 03 Do I want to start a business?",
    text: "It is most definitely my objective to start a company that will be able to thrive in coming years. I am training as a software engineer hoping to slowly close the gap between where Iâ€™m at now and the cutting edge of computer science. I want to create a company that operates on the cutting edge of AI, Quantum computing, or some new up coming technology. With that being said I know that this is an extreme goal that would require years of constant learning about all sorts of theoretical computational algorithms and for quantum computing pioneering a new understanding of quantum physics, so for now my goals are to understand completely full stack development as a gradual step toward my end goal. With an understanding of full stack development practices and a team of programmers I can create a company that will take advantage of the coming quantum computing and AI technology to create an application in those domains. The basic reasoning as to why I want to start a company in the first place is for a few reasons first and foremost being the CEO means I get paid the most! ðŸ˜‚. I would also enjoy the flexibility that comes with being a business owner, aka I get to create my own hours and donâ€™t rely on a company that could eventually fire me. I would also be able to sell the company for enormous amounts of money and use that money to allow myself to study the cutting edge and try to create technology that will empower a better world for all people.",

    title: "Blog 04 Digital Ad",
    text: "For this assignment I was tasked with creating a live digital ad to promote some ventures. My friends and I have been working on a website to help students find and sublease their apartments/ housing. This assignment has brought the perfect opportunity to test the waters and validate the idea and maybe see how many people would sign up. My ad is a very simple one, it contains a nice image of a student apartment with some headlines and hooks to grab users and send them to my website. The picture featured next to or below this text is the picture I used for the ad. Using google ads I had the ability to use multiple headlines and descriptions that tried a different way to hook potential clients.  I went with google ads and my target audience is students at UC who are coming back from coop and are looking to sublease for the different semesters. I was unable to refine my target demographic to be that specific, but I was able to get ads in Cincinnati Ohio which is good enough. I then bought the domain campuscribs.org and created a small page with a form to preregister. This website is where all my traffic will be sent. My call to action was simply Uc Student housing. I thought it was good enough to capture students who needed student housing. The results of this ad were 1.2k impressions and 73 clicks with about 4 people actually filling out the form. My website either had a bug, there is some foul play in google ads or there are some bots that somehow made it to my page as the form was filled out with the same name and different emails for all the people who signed up. With my sample size being only 1200 for all of Cincinnati and not getting any valid people to sign up I will put the campus cribs idea on the back burner and go ahead with my next software Idea.  ",

    title: "Blog 05 Digital Ad 2",
    text: "One of the most exciting emerging technologies right now is Neuralink. The idea of connecting the human brain directly to computers with high-bandwidth interfaces has serious potential, both in the medical field and beyond. At the moment, the focus is on helping people with paralysis control devices with their thoughts, which is already a huge breakthrough. But long-term, this tech could completely change how humans interact with machines. Instead of relying on keyboards, touchscreens, or voice commands, people could communicate directly with computers, making everything from coding to research way more efficient.What really makes this exciting is the potential for brain-computer interfaces to enhance human cognition. AI is advancing fast, and right now, people are limited by how quickly they can process and interact with information. Neuralink could remove that bottleneck, letting humans keep up with AI instead of falling behind. In theory, it could lead to faster learning, better memory retention, and even direct communication between people without speaking.  Of course, there are major challengesâ€”brain surgery isnâ€™t exactly a casual thing, and security risks are a real concern. But if Neuralink (or a similar technology) succeeds, it could redefine how people work, learn, and interact with the world. Itâ€™s still early, but the possibilities are hard to ignore.",
